Originally, this blog was simply a personal project intended to document my trip to Japan in 2024. I began by writing entries in Markdown format and saving them in a GitHub repository, thinking it would be a neat way to keep track of my experiences.

I decided to make it a static website and chose [Astro](https://astro.build/) with the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme to format it better and more neatly. This transition not only brought my travel logs to life online but also opened the door to expanding the blog beyond just travel.
