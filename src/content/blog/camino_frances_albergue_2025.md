description: A complete archive of all the albergues, guesthouses, and accommodations I stayed in during my 41-day Camino Francés and Finisterre/Muxía journey — including distances, ratings, recommendations, and daily notes.
---

I arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on **13 September 2025** and began walking the Camino Francés on **14 September**. Over the next **35 walking days**, I followed the traditional route across the Pyrenees, Navarra, La Rioja, Castilla y León, and Galicia, reaching **Santiago de Compostela on 18 October**. After a rest day in Santiago, I continued with the Finisterre–Muxía extension, completing the journey on **27 October** at the coast in Muxía.

This page records every stage I walked, including distances, accommodations, prices, and short reviews of each albergue and hostal I stayed in.

## SECTION 2 — Day-by-Day Albergue Notes

<a id="day-0"></a>

### Day 0 — Arrival in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Arrival Day)

![camino-frances-day00-cat.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/z8eyl729DQvHtKW.jpg)

**Accommodation:** Maison d'hôtes Larraldia

**Price:** €45 with dinner and breakfast

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A cosy guesthouse slightly outside the centre of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port — a bit farther from town, but very quiet and peaceful, making it a great place to rest before starting the Camino. The dinner is homemade and delicious, and the breakfast includes fruit grown directly from their own garden. The bed and bathroom are very clean, creating a comfortable and relaxing stay to prepare for Day 1.

---

<a id="day-1"></a>

### Day 1 — SJPP → Roncesvalles (24.2 km)

![camino-frances-day01-exterior.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/jfOrLFwPqX7ocJR.jpg)

![camino-frances-day01-bed.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/XIfsJTdr9FvRphS.jpg)

**Accommodation:** Albergue de Peregrinos de Roncesvalles

**Price:** €29 including dinner

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** This is the only accommodation option in Roncesvalles, and the dorm is very large, so it can be noisy at night and difficult to sleep with so many people in one room. At 6am, they play loud choir music to wake everyone up — definitely unexpected! The toilets are acceptable. Dinner is available ; it was okay, and since there are no other food options in Roncesvalles, most pilgrims eat here. Overall, a well-organised monastery albergue and the classic first-night stop for many pilgrims on the Camino Francés.

---

<a id="day-2"></a>

### Day 2 — Roncesvalles → Zubiri (21.4 km)

![camino-frances-day02-exterior.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/FPnNK5RBSfCtUzh.jpg)

![camino-frances-day02-bed.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/P5MpEORDuNVSlCa.jpg)

![camino-frances-day02-dinner.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/LT8NJ3RAPf4FMqa.jpg)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Río Arga Ibaia

**Price:** €17

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A clean and comfortable hostel with a private bathroom in each dorm.

---

<a id="day-3"></a>

### Day 3 — Zubiri → Pamplona (20.4 km)

![camino-frances-day03-bed.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/ntIHqCv2AZ1mTMu.jpg)

**Accommodation:** Hostel Casa Ibarrola

**Price:** €25

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** The hostel has cubicle-style beds with curtains that provide great privacy. There is free coffee, tea and biscuits available in the common area. However, there is only one sink for handwashing, and the drying area is indoors, so clothes can take a long time to dry.

---

<a id="day-4"></a>

### Day 4 — Pamplona → Puente la Reina (23.9 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Estrella Guía

**Price:** €26

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** The hostel has beds with curtains, so there is good privacy. The host is very welcoming, and the beds are comfortable. The washing machine costs €5, and there is an outdoor drying area which helps clothes dry properly.

---

<a id="day-5"></a>

### Day 5 — Puente la Reina → Estella (21.6 km)

![camino-frances-day05-bed.jpg](https://s2.loli.net/2025/12/17/EtipNPgmTUvL5fw.jpg)

**Accommodation:** Ágora Hostel

**Price:** €20

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** The hostel has beds with curtains providing privacy, and the bed is comfortable, although it can get a bit warm at night. There is no washing basin for handwashing clothes, so you need to use their laundry service (€7 for wash and dry), and they fold the clothes and return them to you afterwards.

---

<a id="day-6"></a>

### Day 6 — Estella → Los Arcos (21.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Casa Arqueña

**Price:** €20

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** 100% Yes

**Notes:** Free towels are provided, and the bathroom is spacious and very clean, with shampoo and shower gel available. There is a free washing machine and a rooftop outdoor drying area so clothes dry well. In the kitchen there is complimentary cake, milk and drinks, and the host is extremely kind and welcoming, making it a really memorable stay.

---

<a id="day-7"></a>

### Day 7 — Los Arcos → Logroño (28.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue San Nicolás

**Price:** €28 (booked, cash only)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐

**Recommend:** No

**Notes:** I arrived in Logroño during a wine festival, so the city centre was very chaotic and extremely noisy throughout the night. The bathroom in the albergue is quite small, and there is only an indoor drying area, so clothes are difficult to dry properly. I had booked the albergue in advance (cash only), but due to the noise in the city that night, I decided not to stay and chose to sleep in a hotel instead.

---

<a id="day-8"></a>

### Day 8 — Logroño → Nájera (29.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Puerta de Nájera

**Price:** €15 (cash only)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐

**Recommend:** No

**Notes:** I had booked a female dorm, but on arrival they did not provide one. The room I was given was along the path to another dorm, so people were constantly walking past. The bed was not very comfortable, and whenever the person on the lower bunk moved, the whole bed shook, which made it difficult to rest properly.

---

<a id="day-9"></a>

### Day 9 — Nájera → Redecilla del Camino (21.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Essentia

**Price:** €28 (bed + dinner)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Maybe

**Notes:** The bed was comfortable and the dinner served was tasty and well prepared. However, during check-in when I mentioned I was from Hong Kong, the host kept saying “China” repeatedly, which felt disrespectful and showed a lack of sensitivity. The overall stay was fine, but the attitude could have been more courteous.

---

<a id="day-10"></a>

### Day 10 — Redecilla del Camino → Villafranca Montes de Oca (23.5 km)

**Accommodation:** Casa Rural La Alpargateria

**Price:** €35

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** After staying in dorms for nine nights, I booked this private room for a quiet and comfortable sleep. The room is cozy and provided exactly the rest I needed.

---

<a id="day-11"></a>

### Day 11 — Villafranca Montes de Oca → Orbaneja Riopico (26.3 km)

**Accommodation:** Casa Rural Fortaleza

**Price:** €50

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** I booked a private room with a private bathroom, and I think I was the only guest in the house that night. The room was clean and quiet, but the heating wasn’t working, so it felt a bit cold. There’s no outdoor drying area, which makes laundry difficult. There is only one nearby bar and it closes early, so I couldn’t get a proper dinner that night. You need to call the host about an hour before arriving, as she isn’t on-site — her brother-in-law, who lives nearby, will open the door for you.

---

<a id="day-12"></a>

### Day 12 — Orbaneja Riopico → Rabé de las Calzadas (24.2 km)

**Accommodation:** Hostal Fuente de Rabé

**Price:** €60 (double room) + €13 dinner

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** After many nights in dorms, this was a very welcome private stay. The room was large, with both a double and a twin bed, the heating worked well, and the private bathroom was clean and included a hairdryer. There is a restaurant downstairs where I had a good dinner and a coffee for breakfast. The host was friendly and welcoming.

---

<a id="day-13"></a>

### Day 13 — Rabé de las Calzadas → Castrojeriz (27.5 km)

**Accommodation:** Espacio Interior

**Price:** €15 (bed) + €13 (dinner)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A very relaxing and peaceful albergue with a quiet atmosphere and a meditation area. The vegetarian dinner is delicious and filling, and there are two lovely white cats. Overall it feels like a very calm place to stay.

---

<a id="day-14"></a>

### Day 14 — Castrojeriz → Frómista (24.7 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Luz de Frómista

**Price:** €14

**Rating:** ⭐

**Recommend:** No

**Notes:** This was one of the worst albergues of my whole Camino. The shower only had cold water, the bed and overall cleanliness did not feel good, and you also have to buy disposable paper sheets for €1.50. The bunk bed shook every time the person below moved, making it hard to sleep. The biggest concern was that in the morning, while packing, I saw insects crawling on the bed. Because of all this, I would not recommend staying here.

---

<a id="day-15"></a>

### Day 15 — Frómista → Carrión de los Condes (18.8 km)

**Accommodation:** Hostal Albe

**Price:** €28

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** Great value for a budget single room with a private bathroom. They offer an excellent laundry service: clothes are washed and dried and then returned directly to your room. If you pay in cash, the laundry is free, which makes it an even better deal.

---

<a id="day-16"></a>

### Day 16 — Carrión de los Condes → Ledigos (23.4 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue La Morena

**Price:** €21

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A very nice albergue — clean and comfortable, with real sheets on the beds. There is bottled water and a piece of chocolate placed on each bunk, which is a nice touch. Shower gel is provided in the bathrooms, and the restaurant serves a good pilgrim menu. The only downsides are that the shower room door is quite hard to close, and there is only one sink in the toilet area, so it can get crowded in the morning.

---

<a id="day-17"></a>

### Day 17 — Ledigos → Calzada del Coto (21.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue de Peregrinos San Roque

**Price:** €10 (donativo)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A basic but adequate albergue that covers all the essentials for a night. The hosts are volunteers and are very kind, welcoming and helpful, which makes the stay feel warm and friendly. The dormitory is large with many beds, but the night I stayed there were fewer than 10 people, so it felt quiet and spacious. Breakfast is included.

---

<a id="day-18"></a>

### Day 18 — Calzada del Coto → Villamarco (23.4 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue de Peregrinos La Vieja Escuela

**Price:** €5

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A very cheap albergue — only €5 a night — and great value, especially with a free washing machine available. However, it is located about 1 km off the main Camino route, so there is a small detour to reach it. There is only one nearby bar, and it only sells cold sandwiches, so it’s better to bring your own food as there is no proper dinner option in the area.

---

<a id="day-19"></a>

### Day 19 — Villamarco → Arcahueja (23.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Hotel Camino Real

**Price:** €49.50

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A comfortable hotel stay. I had a menu del día at a nearby restaurant for about €17.

---

<a id="day-20"></a>

### Day 20 — Arcahueja → Oncina de la Valdoncina (19.1 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue El Pajar de Oncina

**Price:** €13 bed / €25 with dinner

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** One of the best albergues on the Camino Francés. It’s a nice and quiet place; the rooms, beds, bathrooms and toilets are all very clean. There is a lovely outdoor area with hammocks, plus a dog and a cat. The host is very kind and welcoming, and the home-cooked dinner is excellent and really delicious.

---

<a id="day-21"></a>

### Day 21 — Oncina de la Valdoncina → Hospital de Órbigo (25.0 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue DORMERO Hidalgos

**Price:** €16

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Maybe

**Notes:** A clean, modern albergue with comfortable beds. The beds are placed quite close to each other, and there is no plug for the upper bunk, which can be inconvenient. Laundry (wash and dry) costs about €6.50, and there are restaurant options nearby for dinner.

### Day 22 — Hospital de Órbigo → Astorga (16.5 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Franciscano Santa María de los Ángeles

**Price:** €10

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A simple and welcoming albergue. For only €10, you actually get a double room with a bathroom, so it feels almost like having a private single room, which is amazing value. During my stay the washing machine was broken, so clothes had to be washed by hand. In the evening, there is Mass with a pilgrim blessing, and they also organise a small pilgrim sharing session, which creates a warm and reflective atmosphere.

**Accommodation:** Refugio Gaucelmo

**Price:** €10 (donativo)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A quiet albergue run by volunteers with a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere.

In the evening, they offer a lovely tea session in the garden with tea, biscuits, and homemade cake, which feels very warm and communal. Breakfast is also included, with coffee provided.

### Day 26 — Valtuille de Arriba → Vega de Valcarce (21.1 km)

**Accommodation:** Albergue-Pensión Fernández

**Price:** €39 (queen room with shared bathroom)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A clean pension with a comfortable bed. Laundry (washing) costs €5. Be cautious about dinner times in the area — the nearby restaurants close early, and I missed the dinner time, so I could only get small tapas in a nearby bar. There aren’t many dining options, so plan ahead if you want a proper meal.

There is also a restaurant inside the albergue/pensión, making it convenient to get a hot meal without going back out into the rain.

### Day F6 — Fisterra → Muxía (27.8 km)

<a id="day-f7"></a>

### Day F7 — Muxía (Rest Day)

**Accommodation:** Albergue Muxía Mare

**Price:** €35 (private room)

**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Recommend:** Yes

**Notes:** A treat to myself after finishing the whole Camino — I booked a private room here, and it was absolutely worth it. The room is very clean, comfortable, and quiet, and you can even see the sunset and the sea from the window, which made the stay feel extra special. As Muxía is right by the sea, it can get quite cold at night, but there are working heaters both in the bedroom and the living room, which made the stay very comfortable.

My private room was within a small shared apartment-style unit, which I shared with a German woman I met along the way, so the common living room and kitchen were shared between just the two of us. The common area also has a free washing machine and all the necessary cutlery for cooking. Overall, a perfect and peaceful place to rest after the long final stage from Fisterra.
