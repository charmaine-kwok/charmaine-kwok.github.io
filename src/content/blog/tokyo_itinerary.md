- **Departure:**
  - **Heading to Narita Airport**: My trip concluded with a somewhat adventurous journey to Narita Airport, which is a bit further from the center of Tokyo. Originally, I planned to take a coach, but due to a road accident, there was a 3-hour delay. Then, I switched to the train, but mistakenly boarded a local service instead of the express. The train stopped at almost every station, and I found myself rushing to the airport. By the time I arrived, the boarding gate had already closed since it closes an hour before departure. Fortunately, the airport staff were kind enough to let me through, ending my trip on a thrilling yet fortunate note.
