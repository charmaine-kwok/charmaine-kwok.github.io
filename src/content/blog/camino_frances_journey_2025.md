description: A personal day-by-day account of my 41-day Camino Francés and Finisterre–Muxía journey, sharing daily walks, weather, reflections, and moments along the way.
---

I arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on **13 September 2025** and began walking the Camino Francés on **14 September**. Over the next **35 walking days**, I crossed the Pyrenees and continued through Navarra, La Rioja, Castilla y León, and Galicia, reaching **Santiago de Compostela on 18 October**. After a rest day in Santiago, I continued to Finisterre and Muxía, completing the journey on **27 October**.

This post focuses on the **day-by-day journey itself** — how each stage felt, the weather, the people I met, and the small moments along the way. Practical details such as accommodation and prices are documented separately.

I arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the afternoon and spent the day settling in, organising my gear, and mentally preparing for the start of the Camino.

### Day 1 — SJPP → Roncesvalles (24.2 km)

I started my Camino early in the morning, knowing that the first day is often described as one of the hardest due to the long uphill climb over the Pyrenees. Before setting off, I met a group of Malaysian guys and even spoke a bit of Cantonese with them.

The weather was very kind to us — cloudy and cool — which made the long ascent much more pleasant than I had expected. Instead of struggling with the heat, I could actually enjoy hiking through the mountains and taking in the views. The climb was manageable.

Near the end of the stage, just before arriving in Roncesvalles, I met a Chinese pilgrim named Leon. We walked the final stretch together and chatted along the way. It was also my first time using trekking poles, and I realised I was using them completely wrong. Leon kindly showed me how to use my waist instead of pressing too hard with my arms, which immediately made walking feel easier. That small tip helped a lot and saved my arms from unnecessary strain.

I spent about **7 hours** walking on my first Camino day before finally reaching the albergue. The Albergue de Peregrinos in Roncesvalles is huge — one floor alone holds around 50 people.

Dinner was at the albergue, and that evening I met a Korean couple. We chatted during dinner, and the girl mentioned that she had studied Spanish during her undergraduate degree. We ended up talking in Spanish for a while — she became my **first Camino friend**, which made the experience feel even more special.

After such a long day, I was exhausted, but sleeping wasn’t easy. I wasn’t used to the constant snoring yet and woke up many times during the night.

In the early morning, everyone was woken up by loud choir music at around **6 a.m.** — honestly quite funny. It was a very Camino-style start to the day.
